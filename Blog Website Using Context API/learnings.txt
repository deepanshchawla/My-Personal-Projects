1. here in this project we will be learning about the context api 

2. the main reason of using this is that, when we have to pass variables from the parent to the child element.

3. we need not to pass the variable to all the children, that decreases the performance of the project, because the variable is unnecessarily passed to all the children
despite of the need, because actually we need the variable only in the 4th child and we are passing it from parent to 1 then 2 then 3 and then 4.

4. so here we will be using the context api, we can consider it as a snapshot of the data.

5. we are capturing the data at the parent component i.e. app.js and then we will be using that data anywhere in any of the component.

6. this way we need not to pass the data to each of the internal component and we can simply use the variable of use only where it is needed.
